<h3>I've been misplaced in so many ways
        Broken battlegrounds, hiding veils of delicate deceit
        Yet here I breathe
        Teeth still gleam from holy water
        While millions of lambs migrate to the slaughter
        My head in a bag and my hands are bound to my feet
        And voices sing

              We lost what we had, but we took it back

  And even if I thought you'd known
  I never would have told you so

  Would have cursed and brought the world on your shoulders

    And how long can I breathe this stolen breath here underneath?</h4>

      An agony reminds where I've been

      Where's your heart?
      Mimicking the patriarch
      She's na√Øve (blissfully)</h4>
