<h3>I've been misplaced in so many ways
        Broken battlegrounds, hiding veils of delicate deceit
        Yet here I breathe
        Teeth still gleam from holy water
        While millions of lambs migrate to the slaughter
        My head in a bag and my hands are bound to my feet
        And voices sing

              We lost what we had, but we took it back
              Friends in the gutter, enjoy one another
              Just give yourself to the dust and the dirt where you stand</h5>
