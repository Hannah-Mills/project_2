    While millions of lambs migrate to the slaughter
    My head in a bag and my hands are bound to my feet
    And voices sing</h5>

        Tossed in a cell to feast with the fleas
        All because we never had written a word"</h5>

    By giving myself to the earth below me

    Just how long can I stay in illusions formed here long before me?
    And how long can I breathe this stolen breath here underneath?</h5>
