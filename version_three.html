    Broken battlegrounds, hiding veils of delicate deceit

    Teeth still gleam from holy water
    While millions of lambs migrate to the slaughter
    My head in a bag and my hands are bound to my feet
    And voices sing</h5>

        Tossed in a cell to feast with the fleas
        All because we never had written a word"</h5>
